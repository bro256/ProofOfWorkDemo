# ProofOfWorkDemo

## Overview
**ProofOfWorkDemo** is a Python program that demonstrates a basic implementation of a proof-of-work algorithm using the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function. The program continuously calculates SHA-256 hashes by varying a nonce and aims to find a hash with the highest number of leading zeros.

> **Note**: This project is still in progress.

## Features
- SHA-256 hashing for cryptographic integrity.
- Continuous nonce variation to find hashes with leading zeros.
- Displays raw bytes, hexadecimal, and binary representations of the hash.
- Counts leading zeros in both binary and hexadecimal formats.

## Installation
To run the program, ensure you have Python 3 installed. Clone the repository and install any necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ProofOfWorkDemo
# If there are dependencies, install them here
